Python Scripting Basics
=======================
The examples from the python scripting basics talk I gave at an [IASG][iasg]
Beginner's Night. The source for the [slides][slides] are also in this
repository. The webserver used for these examples can be found in the
`webserver` directory. To run it, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in
that directory.
